# A Hackable Editor â€“ Build for Modification 

The current practice to get started with our editor and making it your own is not optimal. This starts from the experience to startup the editor the first time, into connecting it to your backend and becomes very hard when it comes to modifying it. Over the years, the details have increased and as always we had to learn how todo better. I believe though that we have been through that and have now turned the corner and know simpler and useful ways to make the editor "hackable". Our credo is 

> Build for modification 

and we want to show off that we can do that.
