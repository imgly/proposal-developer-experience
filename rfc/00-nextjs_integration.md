# Best practices for intergration with other frameworks

1. Provide framework specific hanler (/react)
2. Provide hooks 
3. provide react ui include

Follow the pattern of:

Exporting a createApiHandler(config) or nextHandler(req, res)

Providing middleware, hooks, and React UI

Allowing flexibility: donâ€™t force users to adopt your entire stack
