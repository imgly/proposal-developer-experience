## Main Proposals 

This is the proposal of changes for individual parts of the journey. The general assumption of the Developer Journey is

1. Discover IMG.LY 
2. Quick time to get it up and running
   1. Choose framework (react, ...)
   2. Choose solution (photo, video,...)
   3. Choose theme (dark, light, system)
4. Connect to your infrastructure
   1. Consume Assets
   2. Configure Uploads
   3. Configure downloads
   
5. Configuration of UI 
   1. Feature on/off 
   2. Modify general behavior 
   
6. Translation/Renaming of UI
   1. Change name of Buttons ("Adjustments" -> "Adjust" ) (NOTE: This is not typically a translation case but can be solved via translations)
   2. Change language
   
7. Modification of UI Layout 
   1. Add/Remove Buttons
   2. Add/Remove Panels
   3. Modify Panel Layout
   
8. Modification of UI Style
   1. Modification of Color Theme
   2. Modification of Typography
   3. Modification of Icons
9.  ...
10. Complete Custom UI from scratch 
   

The order might be different for some integration flows though.
