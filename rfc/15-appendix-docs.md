"description": "A photorealistic cinematic 16:9 shot of a minimal pastel creative workspace with light wood flooring and soft daylight streaming in from the side. At the center sits a sealed white toolbox glowing softly with the IMG.LY logo. The toolbox hums, then bursts open in a radiant explosion of pixel particles. Floating midair are editing toolbars, style presets, photo/video editing UI, alignment guides, mobile and browser mockups of embedded editors, floating code snippets (React, Swift, Kotlin), collaboration avatars, comment bubbles, and dynamic canvases with masks, layers, and smart stickers. Subtle cyan and violet LED accents highlight the transformation as the space evolves into a vibrant creative studio. Ambient icons nod to Varys, PESDK, and VESDK. No text. Front-facing wide-angle camera for symmetrical reveal. Ending with a fully active creative suite radiating collaborative energy."
